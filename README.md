Multiplayer Quiz Game implemented using Sockets

Description

There is a host who conducts the show and participants/players who provide answers. Let us say there are three participants. The host has a long list of questions and correct answers with him. He randomly chooses one of the questions (making sure it is not a repeat of previous questions) and sends to all three players. The players receive the question, think about the answer for a while and press the buzzer. There is a timer for 10 seconds for buzzer to be presssed. Otherwise, the host moves on to the next question. The first one to press the buzzer is given a chance to provide the answer within 10 seconds. If the answer is correct, he is given 1 point, otherwise -0.5. Nobody gets chance to answer this question again. The host then proceeds with the next question. The game stops when any player gets 5 points and that player is declared the winner.
